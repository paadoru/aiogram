hey guys its me Alex Root Junior, author of that aiogram thing. yes its me you
can look at the url of the repo and the thingy at the top of the files it
proves its 100% me.

i deleted aiogram because i hate it now i think it sucks. you should go use this
awesome library called [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) i just discovered it its great. 
It has a lot of cool features such ```register_next_step_handler``` instead of that shitty FSM, ```infinity_polling```. 
Oh, and I also forgot to mention that even by the stars [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) is much superior to aiogram.
So many people can't use impractical library, right?
